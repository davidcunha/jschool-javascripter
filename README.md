# JavaScripter

JavaScript can seem pretty similar with other languages you already know. It's easy to learn partially, but much harder to be proficient with it! By the way, JavaScript is not related to the Java programming language ðŸ˜›

In this chapter, we'll learn the basics from variables, data structures, strings, loops, conditionals, to objects and functions before we jump into more advanced topics.

## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

On Windows and using v4 or v5 of Node.js? Make sure you are using at least 5.1.0, which provides a fix for a bug on Windows where you can't choose items in the menu.

### Install `jschool-javascripter` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install --global jschool-javascripter
```

The `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

#### Having issues with installation?

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:

```
sudo npm install --global jschool-javascripter
```

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Take a look at this npm documentation:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions
